# 🎖️ World War II Platformer - C++ Project

A 2D platformer game set in World War II, developed in C++ as the final project for the "Computer Science II" course. The project focused on applying programming knowledge, implementing real-world physics, and developing a collaborative workflow using Git and GitHub.

# 🎯 Project Context and Objectives

This project was the culmination of the Computer Science II course, designed to integrate multiple learning areas into a single, functional application. The main objectives were:
- Apply C++ Knowledge: Build a robust application using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- Implement In-Game Physics: Go beyond simple movements to integrate realistic physics, creating a more dynamic and interesting gameplay experience.
- Develop a Collaborative Workflow: Learn to work as a team on a shared codebase, using Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration, branch management, and merging changes.
  
# 🚀 Implemented Physics and Mechanics

A fundamental part of the development was the integration of physics principles to control key movements in the game:
- Parabolic Motion: Implemented to govern the trajectories of two essential elements:
- Player Jump: The jump follows a natural parabolic arc instead of a simple linear up-and-down movement.
- Grenade Toss: Grenades thrown by the player follow a precise ballistic trajectory, allowing for strategic aiming over obstacles and enemies.
- Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM): In the second level, SHM was used for helicopter movement. Additionally, homing missiles were implemented with a circular projectile launch and player-tracking logic based on -- -   vector subtraction.
  
# 🤝 Teamwork and Role Division

This project was developed by a two-person team. The planning, including the class diagram design, was done jointly to ensure a solid and cohesive foundation. Development responsibilities were divided as follows:

- Juan Pablo González Blandón (My Role):
  Development of the user interface screens (Loading screen, main menu, end-game screen).
  Full implementation of the logic and design for Level 2.
- Juan Jose Balvin Torres:
  Full implementation of Level 1.
  Final project deployment, generating the executable .exe file and its dependencies.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- Framework: Qt (version 4.7.0).
- The Graphics View Framework (QGraphicsScene, QGraphicsView, QGraphicsPixmapItem) was primarily used for rendering and managing the 2D scene.
  QTimer was used for the game loop and timed event management, and QKeyEvent for user input.
- IDE: Qt Creator 4.7.0
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
